            <h2>The Textile Heritage of Tamil Nadu</h2>
            <p>Tamil Nadu boasts a textile history that dates back to the Sangam period (1st century BCE to 6th century CE), where weaving was a prominent craft. The region was renowned for its high-quality cotton and silk fabrics, which were highly sought after both locally and internationally. By the 16th to 18th centuries, Tamil Nadu produced over 280 varieties of textiles, many of which were exported from the ports along the Coromandel Coast, making it a vital hub in the global textile trade.</p>
